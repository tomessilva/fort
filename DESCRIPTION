Description: Provides convenient access to fast structured random linear
    transforms implemented in C++ (via 'Rcpp') that are (at least
    approximately) orthogonal or semi-orthogonal, and often much faster
    than matrix multiplication. Useful for algorithms that require or
    benefit from uncorrelated random projections, such as fast dimensionality
    reduction (e.g., Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform) or kernel approximation
    (e.g., random kitchen sinks) methods.
