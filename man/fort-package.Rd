\title{fort: Fast Orthogonal Random Transforms in R}
\description{
The fort package provides convenient access to fast structured random linear transforms that are (at least approximately) orthogonal or semi-orthogonal, and generally faster than matrix multiplication (in the style of the Fastfood Transform), implemented in C++ (via Rcpp). Useful for algorithms that require or benefit from uncorrelated random projections, such as fast dimensionality reduction (e.g., Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform) or kernel approximation (e.g., random kitchen sinks).
