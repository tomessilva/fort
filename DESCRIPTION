Description: The fort package provides convenient access to fast structured random linear transforms
  that are (at least approximately) orthogonal or semi-orthogonal, and generally faster than matrix
  multiplication (in the style of the Fastfood Transform), implemented in C++ (via Rcpp). Useful for
  algorithms that require or benefit from uncorrelated random projections, such as fast dimensionality
  reduction (e.g., Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform) or kernel approximation (e.g., random kitchen sinks).
